# Monte-Carlo-PI
This C++ program estimates the value of PI using the Monte Carlo simulation (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/), with OpenMP construcuts that bring up performance speedup. This program takes two command-line arguments from the user, n being the number of randomly-generated points and t being the number of threads on which the simulation is run. The main computation is carried out by the function monte_carlo that is parallelized with OpenMP constructs. A timer is set to determine the duration the program takes to complete the computation above. The program display its output on two separate lines, the first being the estimated value of PI and the second being the running time of this program.
